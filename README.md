- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariel Lares Martiz, a postdoc researcher doing Asteroseismology!✨
- 👀 I’m interested in variable stars and their non-linear pulsations. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about non-linear models and Gyrochronology. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the non-linear analysis of pulsating stars using my Best Parent Method code (Lares-Martiz,M. et al., 2020).
